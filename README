JavaScript Client-Side Whitecoin Wallet Generator

Now Whitecoin addresses and their corresponding private key can be conveniently 
generated in a web browser.

The bitaddress.org project provides an all-in-one HTML document with embedded
JavaScript/Css/Images. The JavaScript is readable not minified and contains no
XMLHttpRequest's (no AJAX). The benefit of this technique is you can load the 
JavaScript locally and trust that the JavaScript did not change after being 
loaded.
